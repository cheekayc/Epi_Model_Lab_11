NH=1e7; # human population size
IH = 1; # initial number of infection in humans
SH=NH-IH; # initial susceptible people
muH=1/50/365; # haman mortality rate in days, human life span: 50 yr
vH=NH*muH; # number of new borns per day
TMH = 0.2; # prob infection from human to mosquito;
THM = 0.1; # prob infection from mosquito to human;
gamma=1/7; # infectious period: 7 days
NM=1e8; # mosquito population size
IM=1; # initial number of infection in mosquitoes
SM=NM-IM; # initial susceptible mosquitoes
muM = 1/7; # mosquito mortality rate, 1 week life span for mosquito
vM=NM*muM; # births in mosquito population
b=.5; # number of bite per mosquito per day;
r = b / NH; # bite rate per human per mosquito

# [LQ1] Set up the code for the mosquito-borne disease model using the questions in Slide 5 and Run the model using parameters/initial conditions in Slide 6, for 500 years. (1pt)
# [LQ2] Based on the model-simulated results, what are the peak (i.e. maximum) prevalence values for human and mosquito? (0.5pt)
# [LQ3] Based on the model-simulated results, what is the prevalence of infection for human at equilibrium? 
# [LQ4] Why the prevalence of human infection at equilibrium is much lower than that at the peak? (0.5pt)
# Hint: to understand this, plot the % immune to infection in humans (i.e. the ‘R’ class for humans, or NH – SH – IH) vs. time
